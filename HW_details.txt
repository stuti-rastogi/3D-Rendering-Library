Runs in Release Mode

Tried creating 6 separate renderers, did not work for transformations as they were called only on original renderer.

Used the following approach:
- Only one renderer
- Array of offsetX and offsetY set using putAttribute
- Created new pixel buffer in application to accumulate all the values
- Ran a loop in render method and each iteration added the renderer pixel buffer values to application pixel buffer using weights
- Copied filtered final value from application pixel buffer to renderer pixel buffer to use flush functions
